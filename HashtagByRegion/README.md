# Hashtag By Region
## About
This application is a single module of a much larger project related to the analysis of Covid-19 data. The full project can be found at https://github.com/891-MehrabRahman-CovidAnalysis/covid-analysis-1

This module serves to answer the question: What are the Twitter hashtags used to describe COVID-19 by Region (e.g. #covid, #COVID-19, #Coronavirus, #NovelCoronavirus)?

To answer this question, the application uses Apache Spark and a dataset of approximately 20 million hydrated tweets, gathered from the Twitter API's Covid-19 endpoint.
